Testing was performed using the cobas(R) SARS-CoV-2 test.
This nucleic acid amplification test was developed and its performance
characteristics determined by LabCorp Laboratories. Nucleic acid
amplification tests include PCR and TMA. This test has not been FDA
cleared or approved. This test has been authorized by FDA under an
Emergency Use Authorization (EUA). This test is only authorized for
the duration of time the declaration that circumstances exist
justifying the authorization of the emergency use of in vitro
diagnostic tests for detection of SARS-CoV-2 virus and/or diagnosis
of COVID-19 infection under section 564(b)(1) of the Act, 21 U.S.C.
360bbb-3(b) (1), unless the authorization is terminated or revoked
sooner.
When diagnostic testing is negative, the possibility of a false
negative result should be considered in the context of a patient's
recent exposures and the presence of clinical signs and symptoms
consistent with COVID-19. An individual without symptoms
of COVID-19
and who is not shedding SARS-CoV-2 virus would expect to have a
negative (not detected) result in this assay.
